1. Now since we can retrieve information about class varibales and constructors using reflections. Can we use it for tests purpose?

2. Why constructors are still necessary for simple tasks like initializing variable values. Could we replace constructors with initializers?

3. The @Override annotation ensures that a method in a subclass overrides a method in its superclass. How can you prevent specific methods in the superclass from being overwritten?

4. Does the instance initializer get processed prior to or after the constructor?

5. In Java, what steps are involved in establishing an abstract class?

6. why might a programmer opt for multilevel inheritance of classes? as in under what circumstances?

7. Is it possible to incorporate multiple main functions in a Maven code? How can we execute two tasks (two functions) simultaneously within the same application?
